## üß™ Usage
1. Register and log in on the web app.
2. Upload your blood test PDF.
3. Wait for AI-powered analysis to complete.
4. View, download, or share your report and recommendations.

## ü©∫ How It Works
- **Upload:** PDF is securely stored and queued for analysis.
- **AI Analysis:** Gemini AI and CrewAI agents extract, interpret, and summarize results.
- **Results:** Receive a structured, human-readable report with medical, nutritional, and exercise advice.

---

## üêû Troubleshooting
- **No analysis result?**
  - Ensure your PDF is a real blood test report (not a scan/image-only file).
  - Check that your Gemini API key is valid and set in `.env`.
  - Make sure Redis and Celery are running.
- **Backend errors?**
  - Check logs in the terminal for FastAPI and Celery.
  - Restart the backend after changing environment variables.
- **Frontend issues?**
  - Run `npm install` in the `frontend` folder.
  - Make sure the backend is running on the expected port.
